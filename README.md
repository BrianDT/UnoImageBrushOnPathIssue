# UnoImageBrushOnPathIssue
Sample for a non filled path shape issue

The UI present 3 shapes:
1. A rectangle
2. A rectranular path
3. A curved path

On Android the shapes are not filled at all.

Fills correctly on Windows, WASM and iOS.

The documentation indicating that image brushes do not work on WASM needs updating.
